                        These meaningful words are widely used, but not knowing its meaning...(atleast i didnt knew its meaning till yday)

                        You might be wondering wat this is....believe me, this is exactly what the topic means!!!
                        In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum (or simply lipsum) is standard place holder text used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation. Lipsum also serves as placeholder text in mock-ups of visual design projects before the actual words are inserted into the finished product. When used in this manner, lipsum is also called greeking.

                        Although using "lorem ipsum" often arouses curiosity due to its resemblance to classical Latin, it is not intended to have broader meaning. Where text is visible in a document, people tend to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall presentation, so publishers use lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design in order to direct the focus to presentation. "Lorem ipsum" is also said to approximate a typical distribution of letters in English, which helps to shift the focus to presentation.

                        The most common lorem ipsum text reads as follows:

                        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
                        This passage is used in Microsoft Word as well...see here


                        The text is derived from Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum (On the Ends of Goods and Evils). The original passage began: Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit (Translation: "Neither is there anyone who loves pain itself since it is pain and thus wants to obtain it"). It is not known exactly when the text acquired its current standard form; it may have been as early as the1500s (albeit with subsequent minor changes) or as late as the1960s. The passage was discovered by Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, while trying to find citings of the word 'consectetur' in classical literature.
                        Cicero's original text: "Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum qui dolorem eum fugiat quo voluptas nulla pariatur?"

                        H. Rackham's 1914 translation: "Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
