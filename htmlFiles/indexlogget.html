                        Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has
                        become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest
                        of people regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top
                        fashion magazines. Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.

                        Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential
                        across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance,
                        auto manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has
                        appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how
                        robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her
                        reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first
                        United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an
                        official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights
                        and equality.

                        Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and
                        remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology
                        story.

                        In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum (or simply lipsum) is standard place holder text used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation. Lipsum also serves as placeholder text in mock-ups of visual design projects before the actual words are inserted into the finished product. When used in this manner, lipsum is also called greeking.
